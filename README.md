Digging into Coursera's Algorithms

## Percolation

This assignment encourages you to use UnionFind algorithm(s) in order to solve "Percolation" issue - find out if, let's say a liquid can pass from the top to the bottom of a (metal, soil, etc) grid.
User randomly opens cells in the grid until system percolates.

## Deque and RandomizedQueue

This assignment encourages a student to dig into the implementation of simple dynamic data structures and build 2 more complex ones, which may be extremely useful in many different applications.
Deque is a linked list data structure, which allows you retrieving elements from both its ends;
RandomizedQueue is a linked list/array data structure which provides you with a uniformly random selected elements, once requested.

## Collinear Points

This assignment encourages a student to exploit sorting algorithms in order to achieve NlogN performance in crucial geometrical applications (such as finding 3+ points, which belong to the same line).

## 8 Puzzle

This assignment encourages a student to use a powerful A* algorithm (built on top of MaxPQ) in order to solve a well-known 8/15 etc puzzle problem.

## KdTrees

This assignment encourages a student to exploit BST algorithms when dealing with geometrical applications. KdTree is a BST-like data structure dedicated to solve "points within range" problem.
